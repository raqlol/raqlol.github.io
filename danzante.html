      <p class="item-a icon"><strong>The Brief:</strong>Intwine Marketing was engaged to design, develop, and create content for a website to match Danzante's new label.</p>

      <p><strong>The Job:</strong> I was responsible for creating design deliverables, UI/UX, managing the development team, content creation, and future web management. The project turn around was roughly 4 months to deliver a website with a homepage that features the wines, articles that can be used for other marketing materials, and a store locator.</p>
      <p><strong>The Strategy:</strong> The new label was more modern and abstract than previous designs. It was the star of the new marketing material. We tried  designs that used the same elements, but they overshadowed the label and our strategy for the website was to highlight the new look so it was recongnizable to users. that wanted the site to reflect that aesthetic without overshadowing the new label or limiting our choices to only the elements in the label. Section layout options were created so content creators could combine different elements to make new pages.</p>
      <p>Danzante had a wealth of content: recipes, entertaining tips, and DIY projects. This influenced the final sitemap and appearance. We moved all of the content into a blog, making it easier to navigate and find updates. We also recommended that the site use a CMS to support the blog strategy. </p>
      <p><strong>The Results:</strong> We launched on time with Danzante's first responsive website. The new CMS made the content delivery more efficient and we were able to provide more articles and insights on their performance within the same budget. The website was in use from 2017&mdash;2023, when they introduced their new label.</p>
