           <h1>Github Pages</h1>
           <h3>The first post!</h3>
           <p>I had heard about <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> during an event at Noisebridge. Github Pages allows you to make a site that is hosted directly from your repository. This made a lot of sense for me since I was looking for an easy option to showcase what I was working on. I have a JSFiddle account for prototyping and showing off features, but for polished work, it should be hosted somewhere.</p>
           <h3>Why Github Pages is awesome</h3>
           <ol>
             <li>It's free!</li>
             <li>It's easy to setup</li>
             <li>It is connected to a github repo.</li>
             <li>You choose which branch is live and when you push to it, your site is updated instantly (or a few minutes tops).</li>
             <li>You can connect it to a custom domain.</li>
           </ol>
           <h3>A bit more on the setup</h3>
           <p>I won't go into too much detail about the setup, they make it incredibly easy. <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Start here</a>, I highly recommend that you watch the video. I followed the directions for an organization site using the command line. For step 3, I added my own html, css and js files so that my first commit resulted in this site (mostly) as it appears now. </p>
           <p>Next I needed to setup for the custom domain. Check out the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/" target="_blank">quick start guide</a>. I had purchased my domain years ago so I jumped to step 2. For step 3 I used the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain-and-www-subdomain/" target="_blank">apex and subdomain instructions</a>. I would recommend this options, unless you have a custom subdomain. This is the only section I could forsee someone having issues with, since you'll need to do these things through your DNS provider. I'm using AWS, so I was pretty comfortable changing the A record and CNAME, but I could see this step being a bit of a nail biter if you haven't done it before. After completing this step it took about 30 minutes for my site to go live, but these things can take up to a day. </p>
           <h3>And you're done! Enjoy your new site!</h3>
           <p>For my next post, I'll be recapping the setup of <a href="http://www.Manatee.Foundation" target="_blank">Manatee.Foundation</a>, where we'll be using a similar setup to my site but with the addition of<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/" target="_blank"> Jekyll</a>, which allows for easy blogging using markdown.</p>
