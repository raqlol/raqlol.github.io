        <h1>Creating a Blog</h1>
        <h3>Using Github Pages and Jekyll</h3>
        <p>My first entry was on Github Pages and setting up a site hosted from a Github repository. Now, I'll be reviewing the process of setting up a blog using Pages and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/" target="_blank"> Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a static site generator that is integrated into Github and allows you to make posts using markdown instead of HTML. </p>
        <p>This is perfect for <a href="http://www.Manatee.Foundation" target="_blank">Manatee.Foundation</a> because many of our contributors are already familiar with markdown and don't need a CMS. Originally I tried setting up a the blog as a project page and followed the instructions laid out by Github and Jekyll. It seemed like a success at first until I tried to write a blog post. I kept getting a 404. I could see a link on the blog home page to the newly created post but the post just couldn't be found. So after hours of troubleshooting I decided to fork a successful implementation of a Jekyll blog site. I wish I had been able to figure this out on my own but ultimately <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">Smashing Magazine's guide</a> was the key to getting the blog running. </p>
        <p>From there I updated _layout/default.html to include links to existing css and js files. It isn't necessary to edit any of the other elements in the HTML but I did replace the nav and footer from the main site. Finally, I updated _config.yml with specifics on the site.</p>
        <p>My final assessment: Jekyll is trickier than I thought it would be and I would absolutely recommend forking your site from Smashing Magazine. After combing through the files I'm still unsure of what went wrong on the first attempt. It was absolutely worth going through the process, I read so much documentation during that first attempt and it made the second one feel comfortable and easy. I'll absolutely be updating my own site to use Jekyll.</p>

        <h1>Github Pages</h1>
           <h3>The first post!</h3>
           <p>I had first heard about <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> during an event at Noisebridge. Github Pages allows you to make a site that is hosted directly from your repository. This made a lot of sense for me since I was looking for an easy option to showcase what I was working on. I have a JSFiddle account for prototyping and showing off features, but for polished work, it should be hosted somewhere.</p>
           <h3>Why Github Pages is awesome</h3>
           <ol>
             <li>It's free!</li>
             <li>It's easy to setup</li>
             <li>It is connected to a github repo.</li>
             <li>You choose which branch is live and when you push to it, your site is updated instantly (or a few minutes tops).</li>
             <li>You can connect it to a custom domain.</li>
           </ol>
           <h3>A bit more on the setup</h3>
           <p>I won't go into too much detail about the setup, they make it incredibly easy. <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Start here</a>, I highly recommend that you watch the video. I followed the directions for an organization site using the command line. For step 3, I added my own html, css and js files so that my first commit resulted in this site (mostly) as it appears now. </p>
           <p>Next I needed to setup for the custom domain. Check out the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/" target="_blank">quick start guide</a>. I had purchased my domain years ago so I jumped to step 2. For step 3 I used the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain-and-www-subdomain/" target="_blank">apex and subdomain instructions</a>. I would recommend this options, unless you have a custom subdomain. This is the only section I could forsee someone having issues with, since you'll need to do these things through your DNS provider. I'm using AWS, so I was pretty comfortable changing the A record and CNAME, but I could see this step being a bit of a nail biter if you haven't done it before. After completing this step it took about 30 minutes for my site to go live, but these things can take up to a day. </p>
           <h3>And you're done! Enjoy your new site!</h3>
           <p>For my next post, I'll be recapping the setup of <a href="http://www.Manatee.Foundation" target="_blank">Manatee.Foundation</a>, where we'll be using a similar setup to my site but with the addition of<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/" target="_blank"> Jekyll</a>, which allows for easy blogging using markdown.</p>
