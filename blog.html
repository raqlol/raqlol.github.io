        <h1>All work and no play</h1>
        <h3>How Screeps, the Javascript RTS, helped me with development</h3>
        <p>Find things you're passionate about and work them into all aspects of your life. You already do this without realizing it - you sing in the shower, you ride your bike to work, or you plan a date night. I mention this because sometimes we're unable to get ahead in life because we haven't been able to find a way to be truly excited about the things we need to do.</p>
        <p>I've always been an artist. My dad's place is filled with doodles, paintings and sculptures. As an adult I took what I was passionate about and made it my career. I've designed books, ads, packaging, websites, logos, emails, banners, invitations, brochures, apps ... etc. When speaking to new clients or potential employers, they'd often ask what I like to design most and this always confused me. Design is what I liked to do and each project was a new problem to solve, different rules to follow, and another chance to make something great. When I began working at a small digital agency I took on a lot of non-design responsibility. The best of it was development. Development became an extension of my design and my desire to fully realize my designs pushed me to learn more about development, cross-browser functionality, responsive design &amp; development, performance, and UI. Whenever possible I designed and developed our agency's sites and became our in-house expert on frontend development. This job was what finally pushed me to love programming and since then I've been working my butt off to catch up to my friends with CS degrees.</p>
        <p>Eventually I left the agency and found that it was much harder to keep up the momentum I had for learning. I read through all of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network's</a> documentation on Javascript. I did <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> classes, I referenced <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> constantly but never felt that same level of engagement as I did when I was actively solving a problem at work. This all changed when I found Screeps.</p>
        <p><a href="https://screeps.com/" target="_blank">Screeps</a> is an MMO RTS game that you play using Javascript. I love games, all games, I was even a videogame tester back in college. Yes, it was an awesome job. But, I was a little reluctant  play Screeps  because it was unlike anything I'd played and honestly, I was worried I wouldn't be good at it. But the site has a nice tutorial and it's easy to get started. </p>
        <p> Originally, I didn't alter the tutorial code much. I did ok for a little while until I was released from novice mode and was open prey for other players. My base never stood a chance. I needed to update my code. I didn't want to walk away. </p>
        <p>I was determined to add my own functionality that would allow me to stay away from the game longer without fear of being destroyed in the night. So I made my screeps smarter and more capable. This changed everything, a game that I had micromanage could now be left for weeks without my attention and the real enjoyment I got was from knowing that I built something that could last and popping in when I saw a need to optimize.    </p>
        <p>Screeps reminded me that I like coding and problem solving. I hadn't lost my passion but I was in a rut reading through ES6 documentation and memorizing CSS3 properties trying to prepare for interviews.  Instead of going in with projects to talk about, that show my skill, I would rattle off tech buzzwords. I’m still looking for work, but I have a feeling that passion is what’s been missing when I interview. I’ll put this to the test soon and hopefully write a followup article on landing a killer job and the struggle that got me there. </p>

        <h1>Creating a Blog</h1>
        <h3>Using Github Pages and Jekyll</h3>
        <p>My first entry was on Github Pages and setting up a site hosted from a Github repository. Now, I'll be reviewing the process of setting up a blog using Pages and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/" target="_blank"> Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a static site generator that is integrated into Github and allows you to make posts using markdown instead of HTML. </p>
        <p>This is perfect for <a href="http://www.Manatee.Foundation" target="_blank">Manatee.Foundation</a> because many of our contributors are already familiar with markdown and don't need a CMS. Originally I tried setting up a the blog as a project page and followed the instructions laid out by Github and Jekyll. It seemed like a success at first until I tried to write a blog post. I kept getting a 404. I could see a link on the blog home page to the newly created post but the post just couldn't be found. So after hours of troubleshooting I decided to fork a successful implementation of a Jekyll blog site. I wish I had been able to figure this out on my own but ultimately <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">Smashing Magazine's guide</a> was the key to getting the blog running. </p>
        <p>From there I updated _layout/default.html to include links to existing css and js files. It isn't necessary to edit any of the other elements in the HTML but I did replace the nav and footer from the main site. Finally, I updated _config.yml with specifics on the site.</p>
        <p>My final assessment: Jekyll is trickier than I thought it would be and I would absolutely recommend forking your site from Smashing Magazine. After combing through the files I'm still unsure of what went wrong on the first attempt. It was absolutely worth going through the process, I read so much documentation during that first attempt and it made the second one feel comfortable and easy. I'll absolutely be updating my own site to use Jekyll.</p>

        <h1>Github Pages</h1>
           <h3>The first post!</h3>
           <p>I had first heard about <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> during an event at Noisebridge. Github Pages allows you to make a site that is hosted directly from your repository. This made a lot of sense for me since I was looking for an easy option to showcase what I was working on. I have a JSFiddle account for prototyping and showing off features, but for polished work, it should be hosted somewhere.</p>
           <h3>Why Github Pages is awesome</h3>
           <ol>
             <li>It's free!</li>
             <li>It's easy to setup</li>
             <li>It is connected to a github repo.</li>
             <li>You choose which branch is live and when you push to it, your site is updated instantly (or a few minutes tops).</li>
             <li>You can connect it to a custom domain.</li>
           </ol>
           <h3>A bit more on the setup</h3>
           <p>I won't go into too much detail about the setup, they make it incredibly easy. <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Start here</a>, I highly recommend that you watch the video. I followed the directions for an organization site using the command line. For step 3, I added my own html, css and js files so that my first commit resulted in this site (mostly) as it appears now. </p>
           <p>Next I needed to setup for the custom domain. Check out the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/" target="_blank">quick start guide</a>. I had purchased my domain years ago so I jumped to step 2. For step 3 I used the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain-and-www-subdomain/" target="_blank">apex and subdomain instructions</a>. I would recommend this options, unless you have a custom subdomain. This is the only section I could forsee someone having issues with, since you'll need to do these things through your DNS provider. I'm using AWS, so I was pretty comfortable changing the A record and CNAME, but I could see this step being a bit of a nail biter if you haven't done it before. After completing this step it took about 30 minutes for my site to go live, but these things can take up to a day. </p>
           <h3>And you're done! Enjoy your new site!</h3>
           <p>For my next post, I'll be recapping the setup of <a href="http://www.Manatee.Foundation" target="_blank">Manatee.Foundation</a>, where we'll be using a similar setup to my site but with the addition of<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/" target="_blank"> Jekyll</a>, which allows for easy blogging using markdown.</p>
