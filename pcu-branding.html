        <h3>Brief</h3> 
        <p>Create comprehensive brand guidelines for new hires.</p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>Brand Manager at Provident Credit Union. I led the project to evaluate Provident's current style guide, create a comprehensive brand book, and review all marketing material for brand adherance.</p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3> 
        <p>Create new brand guidelines that are easy to understand and align with the company's strategy and audience.</p>
        <h3>Strategy</h3> 
        <p>Provident didn't have a robust style guide, most of the design knowledge lived with a few people in the department. New employees struggled to make work that felt on brand. I wanted to create a brand book that could tell a new marketing hire everything they needed to make successful content: logos, colors, fonts, photos, audiences, terminology, and how to approach new business needs. I started by interviewing key staff and leadership to make sure everyone was aligned on company persona. I met with content creators to see what their needs were so that the brand book could address grey areas. I also performed the brand audit to discover weak points and create a clear process for reviewing all work for brand adherance.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3> 
        <p>After rolling out the first version of the brand book, the quality of the work started to improve. There was less time needed to create and release new content, because there was less confusion about the design direction or how to write copy. Digital campaign engagement improved by 21%. After 9 months the brand audit score went from 24% to 71%.</p>
